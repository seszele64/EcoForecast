EcoForecast is a data-driven project designed to explore the relationship between weather conditions and renewable energy production in Poland. Utilizing historical weather data from 25 different stations and corresponding daily renewable energy output statistics for the year 2022, this project aims to uncover patterns and trends that influence the renewable energy sector. Through sophisticated data analysis and machine learning techniques, EcoForecast seeks to predict future renewable energy outputs based on forecasted weather conditions, thereby providing valuable insights for energy management and policy-making. This initiative not only helps in optimizing the use of renewable resources but also supports sustainable development goals by enhancing the predictability and reliability of renewable energy sources.
